Define the CI/CD pipeline workflow. Here's an example configuration:


  name: Node.js CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main   # Trigger on push to the main branch
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main   # Trigger on PR targeting the main branch

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest   # The environment for running the pipeline

    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v2   # Checkout the repository code

    - name: Set up Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v2
      with:
        node-version: '14'   # Specify Node.js version

    - name: Install dependencies
      run: npm install   # Install project dependencies

    - name: Run tests
      run: npm test   # Run tests using npm test (ensure you have a test script in package.json)

    - name: Build project
      run: npm run build   # Build project (replace with your build command)

    - name: Upload build artifacts (optional)
      uses: actions/upload-artifact@v2
      with:
        name: build
        path: ./build  # Path to the build artifacts (optional)

  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest   # Environment for deployment

    needs: build   # This job depends on the build job
    if: success()   # Run this only if the build job was successful

    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Deploy to Heroku
      env:
        HEROKU_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.HEROKU_API_KEY }}  # Store the Heroku API key in GitHub Secrets
      run: |
        git remote add heroku https://git.heroku.com/your-heroku-app.git  # Heroku remote URL
        git push heroku main   # Push to Heroku for deployment
